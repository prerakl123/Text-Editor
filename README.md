# Text-Editor
A simple tkinter GUI based text editor in which you can write 79 different language types or create a simple \**.txt* file


## Features
Can change themes, and perform all the basic menu commands commonly present in a text editor (instead of changing font). Shows line number, current cursor position and highlights current line. **'Help'** menu command is left blank because there is nothing much to be helped with.


## Problems
Though everything else works fine one problem still persists ie when you scroll using the scroll bar the numbers are perfectly aligned to their respective lines but if Mouse scroll is used the line numbers either scroll too much or scroll too less, either way they create problem. 
Another problem is that if you scroll to any point in the window and when you start typing in the middle of somewhere the line numbers fo all the way to the top.
If anybody can figure out how to solve this it would be a great help.
